# *Wexford Slang Dictionary*
## MilestoneProject3 - Data Centric Development Milestone Project


Application Demo [Wexford Slang Dictionary](https://murphj99.github.io/MilestoneProject2StarWarsMemoryGame/)


## Description

This application is designed to allow its users to create, view, edit and delete slang/jargon and on a smaller scale than sites like urban dictionary.
The application will store slang/jargon the users create and display these in accordion style lists for other users to view and add their own definitions.
During the testing phase of this application I have found many users enjoying the definitions and prompting an "All Ireland Slang Dictionary".


## UX

The site has been designed with minimalism in mind, to allow users of all ages and levels of computer literacy to enjoy. The site also represents the Wexford County colours purple and gold. The UI is easy to navigate and users can view, add and edit slang words with ease. 
During my research of jargon glossaries I found out that by adding images/photos to slang dictionaries you open up pathways to online bullying so I took the decision to leave the site as text and colours only.

## Future Features

Unfortunately my work life was heavily impacted by Covid19 during the course of this project and my worklife balance was greatly affected. 
As a result I did not get the same amount of time as past projects to implement a lot of the features I would have liked. 
The below are features I would like to include in the future:

- Pagination
- Search based on full / partial name
- Search based on description full/partial
- Views/Likes Functionality
- Analytics on most upvoted & from what countries
- Analytics on most views & from what countries
- Count Page visits
- Errors when incorrect/blank usernames are added
- Add ownership & usernames to each of the added slang Words
- Add an administrative section to approve submitted slang words before being displayed.
- Smoother refreshing when filtering categories
